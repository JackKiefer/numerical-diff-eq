Welcome to the doc site for the ``numerical-diff-eq`` library! This library is a coursework project for the _Numerical Solutions to Differential Equations_ course at Utah State University. 

This open-source website uses MathJax to render mathematical notation, so remember to check your script blocker if things aren't rendering properly. :)

Ensuing below is some fun documentation.

You're a beautiful human being!
