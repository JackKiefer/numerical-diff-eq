This little baby program computes the machine epsilon for your computer. The machine epsilon gives an upper bound on the relative error due to rounding in floating point arithmetic. [Read more about machine epsilon on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_epsilon).

The output will produce a manually calculated machine epsilon as well as one obstained from the C++ standard template library.

#Usage

Compile:

```
cd machine_epsilon
make
```

Run:

```
./epsilon
```
